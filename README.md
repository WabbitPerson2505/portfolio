# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to hold my personal portfolio website.

The repository will contain all important files necessary to run
the portfolio website, including all images and such along with possible
reference to outside projects.

**Note: if you wish to run the website then you will need everything in the public directory.**

**The public directory holds the html code including the assets needed to execute and load the layout.**
